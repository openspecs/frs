# Contributing to FRS

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the FullStack Requirement Standard!

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Use GitHub Issues for bug reports, typos, or unclear sections
- For feature requests, open a Discussion first

### Submitting Changes

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** from `main` (`git checkout -b fix/typo-in-section-4`)
3. **Make your changes** following the style of existing content
4. **Submit a Pull Request** against `main`

### Branch Naming

- `fix/` - Corrections, typos, clarifications
- `feat/` - New sections or fields
- `docs/` - README, examples, tooling docs

### PR Requirements

- Clear description of what and why
- Reference any related issues
- One logical change per PR (don't bundle unrelated changes)

## Review Process

All PRs require review and approval from a maintainer before merging. We aim to review within 5 business days.

## Style Guide

- Use RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) consistently
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Prefer clarity over brevity

## Questions?

Open a Discussion or reach out to the maintainers.
